# TTHD-Textures
An AI upscaled texture pack for Tonic Trouble (Retail).

If you want to know how to use this texture pack yourself go [here](https://raymanpc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=74787). 

# Instructions on how to import the textures into a Textures.cnt file:

Get the latest version of [Rayman Control Panel](https://github.com/RayCarrot/RayCarrot.RCP.Metro/releases).

Go to the "Utilities" tab and open the "Textures.cnt" file. It should be located in the "GAMEDATA" folder of Tonic Trouble (Retail).

Right click on the folder that contains the texture(s) you want to replace and click "Import & convert". If you want to replace textures in multiple folders just right click the root directory and import there. 

Once you've saved your changes make sure to sync the texture info before you start the game. "Utilities>Other" select the GAMEDATA folder when syncing.
